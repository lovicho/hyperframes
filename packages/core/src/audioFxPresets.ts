/**
 * Named starting points for the FX rack.
 *
 * Voice carve turned a pile of effects into one understandable feature. These
 * do the same for the cases an analysis cannot decide: a preset is a chain
 * somebody already tuned, applied in one click and editable immediately
 * afterwards.
 *
 * A preset is DATA, deliberately. Applying one writes ordinary nodes into
 * `data-fx-chain` — the same nodes hand-building would produce — so there is no
 * second code path to keep in agreement with the rack, nothing new in the
 * render, and no failure mode the chain does not already have. The author can
 * see everything that was written on their behalf and change any of it.
 *
 * Only the parameters a preset actually means are listed; `normalizeAudioFxParams`
 * fills the rest from the effect's own defaults. That keeps each entry readable
 * as an intent rather than a dump of every knob.
 *
 * Node ORDER is load-bearing — the chain is serial, so a limiter first and a
 * limiter last are different sounds. Every preset below runs
 * subtractive filtering → dynamics → tone → character → limiter, the order
 * `skills/hyperframes-audio` already teaches.
