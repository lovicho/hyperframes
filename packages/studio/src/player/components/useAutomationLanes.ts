/**
 * Writes for the timeline's audio automation lanes.
 *
 * Kept out of TimelineLanes so that component does not grow another concern.
 * Reading lives in `automationLaneData`, shared with the row layout, which needs
 * the lane count to reserve height.
 *
 * Edits go to the *selected* element, because that is what the attribute commit
 * path targets. An unselected clip still draws its envelopes — they are just
 * read only, which is also what stops a stray drag from editing the wrong track.
