 * Fail if this branch would delete files that exist on the base.
 *
 * Written after a scare that turned out to be a measurement error, which is
 * the reason it uses the three-dot form. Comparing tip to tip (two dots) on a
 * branch that is a month behind reports every file main added since the merge
 * base as a deletion: 1,284 of them, including an entire skills tree. None of
 * that is real. A merge keeps main's side, and a pull request shows the
 * three-dot diff, which reported zero.
 *
 * So this exists to catch deletions a branch genuinely proposes, and to make
 * the distinction hard to get wrong again. If it ever disagrees with a manual
 * git diff, check which form the manual one used before believing it.
 *
 * Renames are reported separately. In a name-only diff a rename is
 * indistinguishable from a deletion, so treating them alike would either mask
 * real loss or block every legitimate move.
